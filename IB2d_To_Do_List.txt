%
% LAGRANGIAN STRUCTURE 
%
1. Finish force calculation for 3-Element Hill Model
2. Update porous connections
3. Fix Lagrangian Pts. passing through boundaries (for periodic domains)
4. Add non-invariant beams (now just have torsional springs)

%
% FLUID SOLVER / BLACK-BOX
% 
1. Optimize muscle model force computations
2. Add neuro-mechanical coupling via FitzHugh-Nagumo
3. Stoke's Fluid Solver
4. Non-Newtonian Fluid Solver
5. Parallelization
6. Port code to Python

% EXAMPLES
%
1. Fix Jellyfish FORWARD swimming examples
        -update_beam() curavture example
        -springs and beams forward swimming example
        -springs only forward swimming example
2. Fix muscle model parameters for both types
        -Length-Tension/Force-Velocity model
        -3-Element Hill Model / LT-FV model
